## Project Overview

The Smart Waste Management System is an innovative web application developed to solve real-world problems related to waste management. The system enhances waste collection, recycling, and resource management through intelligent technologies.

## How the System Works

### User Roles

1. **Household Users**
   - Register and log in to the system.
   - Schedule waste collection and receive notifications.
   - Track recycling efforts.

2. **Waste Collection Services**
   - Manage collection routes and schedules.
   - Track performance.

3. **Administrators**
   - Monitor overall system performance.
   - Manage users  and Waste collectors via an admin dashboard.

### Features and Functionalities

1. **User Registration and Login**
   - Users can register and log in using a secure authentication system.
   - User sessions are managed with Flask-Login.

2. **Waste Collection Schedule**
   - Household users can schedule waste collection.
   - Notifications are sent to remind users of their scheduled collection times.

3. **Recycling Tracker**
   - Users can track their recycling efforts.

4. **Waste Collection Services Management**
   - Waste collection services can manage and optimize their collection routes.
   - Performance tracking helps in improving efficiency.

5. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Administrators have access to a comprehensive dashboard.
   - The dashboard provides insights into system performance and user activity.
   - Admins can manage users and system configurations.

### Frontend Development

- **HTML**: Structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling of the application to ensure a modern, user-friendly interface.
- **JavaScript**: Enhances interactivity and responsiveness of the application.
- **Bootstrap**: Used as a CSS framework for a responsive design.

### Backend Development

- **Flask**: Used as the primary web framework.
- **MySQL**: Database management system.
- **RESTful API**: Backend API endpoints for frontend and backend communication.

### Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Written using the Unittest module to ensure critical parts of the application function correctly.
- **Code Coverage**: Ensures high reliability and performance of the application.

### Continuous Integration and Deployment

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implemented using GitHub Actions to automatically run tests and deploy the application.
- **Docker**: Used for containerization and deployment of the application on services like Heroku or AWS.

This Smart Waste Management System provides an integrated solution for efficient waste management, ensuring that users can easily schedule waste collection, track recycling efforts, and manage overall waste management processes effectively.
