# Smart Waste Management System

## Project Overview

The Smart Waste Management System is an innovative web application developed to solve real-world problems related to waste management. The system enhances waste collection, recycling, and resource management through intelligent technologies.

## How the System Works

### User Roles

1. **Household Users**
   - Register and log in to the system.
   - Schedule waste collection and receive notifications.
   - Track recycling efforts and view environmental impact metrics.

2. **Waste Collection Services**
   - Manage collection routes and schedules.
   - Track performance and optimize routes.

3. **Administrators**
   - Monitor overall system performance.
   - Manage users and system settings via an admin dashboard.

### Features and Functionalities

1. **User Registration and Login**
   - Users can register and log in using a secure authentication system.
   - User sessions are managed with Flask-Login.

2. **Waste Collection Schedule**
   - Household users can schedule waste collection.
   - Notifications are sent to remind users of their scheduled collection times.

3. **Recycling Tracker**
   - Users can track their recycling efforts.
   - The system provides metrics on the user's environmental impact.

4. **Waste Collection Services Management**
   - Waste collection services can manage and optimize their collection routes.
   - Performance tracking helps in improving efficiency.

5. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Administrators have access to a comprehensive dashboard.
   - The dashboard provides insights into system performance and user activity.
   - Admins can manage users and system configurations.

### Frontend Development

- **HTML**: Structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling of the application to ensure a modern, user-friendly interface.
- **JavaScript**: Enhances interactivity and responsiveness of the application.
- **Bootstrap**: Used as a CSS framework for a responsive design.

### Backend Development

- **Flask**: Used as the primary web framework.
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM used for database interactions.
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL**: Database management system.
- **RESTful API**: Backend API endpoints for frontend and backend communication.

### Data Structures and Algorithms

- **Data Structures**: Arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs are used to manage various aspects of the application.
- **Algorithms**: Scheduling, route optimization, and data analytics algorithms enhance system efficiency.

### Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Written using the Unittest module to ensure critical parts of the application function correctly.
- **Code Coverage**: Ensures high reliability and performance of the application.

### Continuous Integration and Deployment

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implemented using GitHub Actions to automatically run tests and deploy the application.
- **Docker**: Used for containerization and deployment of the application on services like Heroku or AWS.

## System Components

### HTML Files

- **index.html**: Homepage of the application.
- **login.html**: User login page.
- **register.html**: User registration page.
- **schedule.html**: Page for scheduling waste collection.
- **recycling_tracker.html**: Page for tracking recycling efforts.
- **admin_dashboard.html**: Admin dashboard for managing the system.

### CSS Files

- **styles.css**: Custom styles for the application.
- **bootstrap.min.css**: Bootstrap framework for responsive design.

### JavaScript Files

- **scripts.js**: Custom JavaScript for application interactivity.
- **bootstrap.min.js**: Bootstrap JavaScript framework.

### Flask Components

- **app.py**: Main application file containing Flask routes and configurations.
- **models.py**: Database models defined using SQLAlchemy.
- **forms.py**: Form classes for user input handling.
- **routes.py**: Defines the application routes and their corresponding functions.
- **config.py**: Configuration file for the Flask application.

### Database

- **PostgreSQL/MySQL**: Used to store user data, waste collection schedules, recycling efforts, and other application data.

### Additional Tools

- **Fabric**: Used for deployment and management tasks.
- **Flask-Login**: Manages user sessions and authentication.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates testing and deployment through a CI/CD pipeline.

This Smart Waste Management System provides an integrated solution for efficient waste management, ensuring that users can easily schedule waste collection, track recycling efforts, and manage overall waste management processes effectively.
